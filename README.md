# AngularDotNetCoreAPI

# What
The purpose of this application is to support my job search as a Tech Lead in quality software development.  It is a simple API that connects to a SQL database where you can create products and users. Think of a simple e-commerce platform that can be coupled with any UI. The .Net Core API and SQL databsase are hosted on Azure and the Angular UI on Firebase.

# Why
I have been interviewed for some really interesting jobs lately, and by seemingly skilled developers no less. However, the amount of time I have had to deal with poor communication skills is more than I can count. I have been asked questions about things I use on a daily basis but had no idea what they were really asking. Some favored the memorization of syntax that is easily searchable over the discussion of concepts, strategies, approaches and evaluating my people skills. Others evaluated me over features that were not even in the scope of the applications they asked for. 

I have interviewed many talented developers in my career and I understand the purpose is to screen and confirm that they can back what is on their resume. But if I am interviewing .net developers, I am not going to waste their time asking about syntax that ‘intellisense’ was made to spell check. Instead I will focus on creativity, provide a problem with no right answers and watch their thought process, understand if they can fit into my existing team, etc.

As a solution to the above, I have decided to create a demo application to show interviewers WHAT I can do and HOW I do it. 

I can screen-share and walk interviewers through the whole app and make ad hoc changes if requested.

Also, this is a public repository, so feel free to use any parts of it for your own needs.
